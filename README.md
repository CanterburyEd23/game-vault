## 1.  About

The Game Vault app is a project I built to further my own understanding of React and Redux, and to grow more comfortable using these powerful tools.  It allows a user to view a list of all of my games, to filter this list in various ways, and to add a new game to the list.  Its usage is straightforward, and (hopefully) self explanatory.

## 2. Technology used

This was written in VSCode, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, working with React and Redux.  It has allowed me to become more familiar with managing state across a slightly more complex app than I've made up to now, making use of different slices of state to configure the redux store.  It's also seen me use a few little simple features like drop-down menus and css pseudo-classes for links that I've not made use of before.  All in all, I've learnt a lot whilst creating this, and feel better equipped to push forwards with my Codecademy course.

## 3. Future

There are a few features to add to this app in the future, as I find the time.  
The ability to delete games from the list should be implemented.
An additional filter option of a minimum game time, would help to narrow the list down more.
A button to recommend a random game from the rendered list as an alert would be a nice little touch.
Buttons that show or hide the addGameForm and the filtersForm would help tidy the app up a little.
